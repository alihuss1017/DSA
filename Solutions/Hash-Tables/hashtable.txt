Dictionary is the Python implementation of a hash map/hash table.
Dictionaries are more efficient when you want to access a value based on specific information.
Example: What was the price of a stock on March 9?
In this case, you would have to iterate through an array to answer this (time = O(n)), while you can 
simply access the price by using the date as an index (time = O(1))

Look up by key is O(1)
Insertion/deletion is O(1)
